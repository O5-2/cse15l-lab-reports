**Command: cd**

*Using the command with no arguments:*

Working directory before the command was run: /home

Reason for result: No path was provided to the command, so it did not go anywhere.

Was result error?: No. If no argument is provided, then this command is meant to do nothing.

*Using the command with a path to a directory as argument:*

Working directory before the command was run: /home

Reason for result: The relative path ./lecture1 was given, and the command changed the working directory to that directory.

Was result error?: No. The OS did not throw an error.

*Using the command with a path to a file as argument:*

Working directory before the command was run: /home/lecture1

Reason for result: The relative path Hello.java was given, but the command could not be executed because the path led to a file and not a directory.

Was result error?: Yes. cd should only be used for directories.

**Command: ls**

*Using the command with no arguments:*

Working directory before the command was run: /home

Reason for result: The OS listed the contents of the working directory (/home).

Was result error?: No. The command ran successfully.

*Using the command with a path to a directory as argument:*

![Image](CSE15L_Lab1_2b.png)

Working directory before the command was run: /home

Reason for result: The OS interpreted the argument as a file path (a relative one), and listed the contents of the resulting directory (/home/lecture1).

Was result error?: No. The command ran successfully.

*Using the command with a path to a file as argument:*

![Image](CSE15L_Lab1_2c.png)

Working directory before the command was run: /home/lecture1

Reason for result: The OS recognized that the argument was a file path leading to a file, and printed the name of that file.

Was result error?: No. Printing the name of a file is intended behavior for the ls command.

**Command: cat**

*Using the command with no arguments:*

![Image](CSE15L_Lab1_3a.png)

Working directory before the command was run: /home/lecture1

Reason for result: Without an argument, the OS used the terminal as the input, thus causing it to echo anything typed by the user until the command was halted.

Was result error?: No. Using the terminal as input, in the absence of an argument, is intended behavior for the cat command.

*Using the command with a path to a directory as argument:*

![Image](CSE15L_Lab1_3b.png)

Working directory before the command was run: /home/lecture1

Reason for result: The relative path messages was given, but the command could not be executed because the path led to a directory and not a file.

Was result error?: Yes. cat should only be used for files.

*Using the command with a path to a file as argument:*

![Image](CSE15L_Lab1_3c.png)

Working directory before the command was run: /home/lecture1

Reason for result: The OS interpreted the argument as a file path (a relative one), and printed the contents of the file that the path led to.

Was result error?: No. The command ran successfully.
